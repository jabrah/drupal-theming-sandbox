This repository is meant to be used as a sandbox for freeform experimentation with Drupal theming.

I have been using the Acquia Dev Desktop 2 (https://dev.acquia.com/downloads). To use the theme in this repository:

* Install and start up Acquia Dev Desktop
* You can use this theme within an existing local Drupal deployment, or you can create a new clean deployment
* Goto the Drupal directory in your file system, which should be linked from the dev desktop
* Clone this repository in `<drupal_dir>/themes/custom/`
* Open the your Drupal site in your browser. The dev desktop provides a clickable link
* Enable the custom theme using the Drupal admin UI
  * Click the Appearance tab
  * Scroll down to "Unintalled Themes" section
  * Click "Install and set as default"
